# How to use this to create your report
A basic know-how of Latex is recommended. The .cls file is the style file that
contains all the style information for creating report according to NIT Hamirpur
format. You can view the sample.tex file. It will give you a hint how you can
use the .cls file in your project. You can start creating your own project
report by modifying sample.tex. You don't need to touch .cls file at all. It is
meant to be kept in the same directory where you are writing your major project
report in .tex format. To setup the latex environment on your PC, you can
install any latex software available according to your distribution. In linux,
you can use texMaker, for instance, or Latexila. You can also do it in
commandline by using tools like latexmk, or pdflatex. To compile with citations
successfully, you need compile the .tex file twice in order to make it work.
Additionally according to your distribution, you may need to install few packages to setup the whole latex
environment for you.
